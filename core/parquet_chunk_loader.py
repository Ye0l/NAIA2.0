"""Chunked parquet reader — load a large parquet in row-batch chunks.

Startup restore and custom parquet load/merge used a single blocking
``pd.read_parquet`` of the whole file, which on a large temp/runner pool stalls
the search pool readiness (and, on low-spec machines, the whole app) while the
one long GIL-holding conversion runs. Reading in batches lets the caller report
progress and yields the GIL between batches so an asyncio event loop stays
responsive during the load. The returned DataFrame is identical to
``pd.read_parquet`` (columns/dtypes) for the index-less parquets we write
(``to_parquet(index=False)``); callers reset_index anyway.

The progress callback receives ``(loaded_rows, total_rows)`` — ``total_rows`` is
read from the file metadata up front (0 if unavailable), and is called once with
``(0, total)`` before the first batch so a UI can show a determinate bar.
